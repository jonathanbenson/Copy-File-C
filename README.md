# Usage

mycopy.c takes two arguments: a source file and a destination file. It copies the contents from the source file and writes (overrides) the contents of the destination file.

# Demo

1. Compile the mycopy.c file down to an executable.
2. In a CLI, run mycopy.exe with the arguments "source.txt" and "dest.txt".
3. After running, source.txt will have written its contents to dest.txt
